    "# EECE 5554 Lab 4: Introduction to Dead Reckoning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Lab 4 introduces the principles of dead reckoning using walking data. This lab will demonstrate why dead reckoning is a hard problem! Please note that we do not expect you to have beautiful results. The goal here is to learn the strengths and weaknesses of dead reckoning and IMU data before you try it in NUance for Lab 5!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals and Objectives\n",
    "We would like to understand the outputs from the VectorNav IMU magnetometer, gyroscope, and accelerometer during walking. We will attempt to use these data to reconstruct a walking path. \n",
    "\n",
    "### By the end of this lab, we expect that a well-prepared student will be able to:\n",
    "- Calculate a calibration from magnetometer data using least squares\n",
    "- Plot gyro and accelerometer data and time integrals of these data\n",
    "- Reason about sources of non-idealities and error in data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Individual and team work: \n",
    "- Individual work: Make your plots as described below <br>\n",
    "- Team work: Data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration Policy for this Lab\n",
    "- Everyone in the team needs to generate their own figures. You should not collaborate at all with others on this figure creation.\n",
    "- Everyone needs to make their own CAD/STL file \n",
    "- Data will be collected as a group\n",
    "\n",
    "## Information of Note\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware: \n",
    "- Vectornav VN-100 IMU \n",
    "\n",
    "### Software:\n",
    "- Solidworks, Autodesk Fusion 360, or any other 3D modeling software you are comfortable with\n",
    "\n",
    "For tutorials about how to use Solidworks or Autodesk Fusion, if you have not before, please see LinkedIn Learning, which Northeastern has a subscription to. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can request a free student license through the Autodesk website for Fusion, and Northeastern has information on student licenses for Solidworks here: https://coe.northeastern.edu/computer/coe-solidworks-download/\n",
    "\n",
    "### The IMU driver:\n",
    "You will use your IMU driver from Lab 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data sets: \n",
    "- One data set of walking in a circle\n",
    "- One data set of walking in a square\n",
    "- Videos from both these trials \n",
    "\n",
    "### What, where, and how to submit: \n",
    "\n",
    "Please upload *a PDF* with your 14 plots sequentially labeled, then a page break with answers to your two questions. Please also upload a zip of your STL file. We cannot accept SLDPRT files, and these will unfortunately receive no credit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please push your analysis/plot scripts to your Github repo. You do not need to push or upload your rosbags or videos anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repository structure:\n",
    "You do not need a specific repository structure for this lab. Please name the directory lab 4. "

    "## Team work: collect two datasets of walking data using the IMU driver from Lab 3 \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Go outside to an area where you can walk in a circle of at least 5 m diameter.\n",
    "- One teammate should hold the IMU, one should hold the laptop, and one should record a video while you are walking. \n",
    "- Try to hold the IMU so that the x-axis is aligned with the walking direction and the VN is parallel to the ground. Watch the cable length.\n",
    "- Begin recording a ROSbag.\n",
    "- Walk in a circle at constant pace for 3-5 revolutions, picking a landmark to revolve around (like a rock, tree, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wish to look at the analysis required below and think about the best way to position and hold the VectorNav to make your life easier before you begin to collect data!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Repeat the above steps with a square 5 m or larger on a side. \n",
    "- Try to face in a cardinal direction (N, E, S, W) and make a precise 90 degree turn. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed the datasets, share the .bag and video among the group. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Individual work: data analysis using the ROSbag data, your video, and your knowledge of the area\n",

    "You should not collaborate beyond this point. It is OK to ask the TAs or instructors for help.\n",

    "#### For your circle Rosbag (Figs. 1-7):\n",
    "- Plot the N vs. E components of magnetic field and apply calibration to your dataset. Plot two sub-figs or two marker styles on the same figure to display the data before and after calibration (Fig. 1)\n",
    "- Plot rotational rate around X and rotation from the gyro around X (integrate once) on two subplots. Repeat for axis Y. (Fig. 2-3)\n",
    "- Plot rotational rate around Z, rotation from the gyro around Z (integrate once), and magnetometer heading (calculate atan2(X/Y)) on three subplots. (Fig. 4)\n",
    "- Plot acceleration in X, velocity in X (integrate once), and displacement in X(integrate twice) vs. time as three subplots.(Fig. 5). Repeat for axes Y and Z (Fig. 6-7).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For your square ROSbag (Figs. 8-14):\n",
    "- Plot the N vs. E components of magnetic field and apply calibration that you found from Fig. 1 analysis to your dataset. Do not recalibrate. Plot two sub-figs or two marker styles on the same figure to display the data before and after calibration (Fig. 8)\n",
    "- Plot rotational rate around X and rotation from the gyro around X (integrate once) on two subplots. Repeat for axis Y. (Fig. 9-10)\n",
    "- Plot rotational rate around Z, rotation from the gyro around Z (integrate once), and magnetometer heading (calculate atan2(X/Y)) on three subplots. (Fig. 11)\n",
    "- Plot acceleration in X, velocity in X (integrate once), and displacement in X (integrate twice) vs. time as three subplots.(Fig. 12). Repeat for axes Y and Z (Fig. 13-14).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use your data to answer these questions. You should include both quantitative and qualitative observations and draw on your plots:\n",
    "- Write 2-3 sentences about your observations and whether your results \"make sense\" given the ground truth recording of your video.\n",
    "- Write 2-3 sentences about what revisions you might make to your setup to collect \"clean\" data for lab 5, when you are driving around in NUance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VN holder:\n",
    "- Look up the dimension of the Vectornav in the manual (or measure them)\n",
    "- Create a 3D model of a small platform that the VN can nest inside that will keep it from moving during data collection in lab 5. The x-axis should point in the same direction as forward motion of the car. This platform can be placed on the armrest or in the cupholder in the car you'll use for lab 5 (your own vehicle).\n",
    "- Zip and submit this .STL. Your Lab 5 team will select one design to print using the 3D printers in the makerspace, so please make sure this design can be printed and is physically reasonable. Don't forget tolerances! "
