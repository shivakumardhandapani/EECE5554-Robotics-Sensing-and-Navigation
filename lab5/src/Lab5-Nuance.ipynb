    "\n",
    "### Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "- If any teammate has access to a car, it might be more convenient to use that vehicle for data collection so that you can do it on your team’s schedule.\n",
    "- Alternatively, a team can schedule to use our autonomous car ‘NUANCE’ for data collection. To drive NUance, you must be a graduate student with a US drivers license, or Northeastern van-certified. \n",
    "\n",
    "If your group wishes to take NUance out, please complete the link on Piazza to schedule and we'll be in touch with a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 0: Prepare for data collection\n",
    "Before embarking, test everything by collecting data from both the GPS and IMU sensors. Make sure you can see and record both gps msgs and imu msgs on your machine. Decide on roughly a 10 minute driving loop that starts and ends at Ruggles station or other location that you are using for magnetometer calibration. Be ready to share this route with your driver (see “mini Boston tour” for details on a good route).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Launching your drivers \n",
    "To collect data from both the GPS and IMU sensors, create a single launch file that launches both your GPS & IMU driver nodes, and make sure you are able to see both gps and imu topics on your machine. The two topics should exist & be publishing data together successfully. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can verify data is being published by opening multiple terminal windows and doing <code>rostopic echo gps</code> and <code>rostopic echo imu</code> in separate windows. To ease things, we suggest installing terminator by <code>sudo apt-get install terminator</code>. It will allow you to have multiple terminal screens in one window instead of switching tabs or windows.\n",
     "\n",
    "Note: To enhance the synchronization between GPS and IMU data, we propose a transition to using epoch time within the IMU driver, moving away from the system time approach adopted in labs 3 and 4. This modification is aimed at achieving more accurate time alignment between the datasets. We suggest implementing this change by utilizing the <code>rospy.Time.now()</code> function. This function enables the retrieval of the current time in epoch format, facilitating improved coherence and synchronization accuracy across our system's data.",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Before data collection (keep the car turned off until specified)\n",
    "- Mount the IMU inside your vehicle using your IMU holder that you built in Lab 4. The IMU holder should fit in the cup holder of your car.  Make sure that the x –axis is pointed forward and that the IMU is horizontal (verify with a leveling app on your phone). \n",
    "- Fix the GPS puck to the roof – it has a magnetic back and should just stay there. \n",
    "- Now connect both sensors to one single laptop and launch the two nodes. These two nodes should never die during this data collection, so do not turn them off.  \n",
    "- If a USB unplugs or if one of them crashes, you must collect your entire dataset again. We suggest one member monitors the screen & ensures topics are being published.\n",
    "- Use electrical tape to make strain reliefs on your cables to prevent cable movement from misaligning the IMU or a USB plug from coming out of its socket.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Calibrate and store messages in a ROSbag \n",
    "- Begin a rosbag and call it data_going_in_circles.bag\n",
    "- Wait 10 - 15 seconds\n",
    "- Start your car\n",
    "- Drive the car in circles 4-5 times (the more circular the path, the better). One suggested place is the Ruggles circle near Centennial common.\n",
    "- Stop recording only the rosbag. Do not turn off the car or the driver nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Drive and store messages in a ROSbag \n",
    "- Begin a rosbag and call it data_driving.bag. \n",
    "- You might want to make a video of your route as you drive, it may help understand any data anomalies.\n",
    "- Wait 10 - 15 seconds.\n",
    "- Go for a drive around Boston AND return to the spot where you started. We suggest a total distance of 2 – 3 kilometers with a MINIMUM of 10 turns. \n",
    "- Do not go underground/in tunnels to keep the GPS signal. Enjoy the view (whether outdoors or on the linux screen).\n",
    "- Once you return to the spot you started from, stop the rosbag recording\n",
    "- You can now turn off your car & your ROS drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow all local & state traffic laws. Always yield to pedestrians. And remember that not everyone likes robots. "

    "### Plots to submit: \n",
    "- A plot showing the magnetometer data before and after the correction in your report.\n",
    "- The magnetometer yaw estimation before and after hard and soft iron calibration vs. time\n",
    "- Plot of gyro yaw estimation vs. time \n",
    "- Low pass filter of magnetometer data, high pass filter of gyro data, complementary filter output, and IMU heading estimate as 4 subplots on one plot\n",
    "- Plot of forward velocity from accelerometer before and after any adjustments\n",
    "- Plot of forward velocity from gps\n",
    "- Plot of estimated trajectory from GPS and from IMU velocity/yaw data (2 subplots)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Estimate the heading (yaw)\n",
    "- Building on your approach from lab 4, correct your magnetometer readings for \"hard-iron\" and \"soft-iron\" effects using the data collected  when going around in circles. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Heading estimation\n",
    "All further analysis will now be performed with data from data_driving.bag and the previously obtained calibration will be used for the magnetometer.\n",
    "- Calculate the yaw angle from the magnetometer calibration & plot the raw magnetometer yaw with the corrected yaw for comparison. Going forward, only use the corrected magnetometer yaw.\n",
    "- Integrate the yaw rate/gyro sensor to get yaw angle. One way to do this is to use a cumulative trapezoid function, as shown in the plots and stats notebook. You are free to use another function if the results are better.\n",
    "- Compare the yaw angle from above two methods. (Magnetometer vs. Yaw Integrated from Gyro).\n",
    "- Use a complementary filter to combine the yaw measurements from the magnetometer and yaw rate/gyro to get an improved estimate of the yaw angle (filter the magnetometer estimate using a low pass filter and gyro estimate using a high pass filter).  You might find tools that wrap angle values between $-\\pi$ and $\\pi$ useful.\n",
    "- Plot the results of the low pass filter, high pass filter & complementary filter together.\n",
    "- Compare your sensor fusion yaw result with the yaw angle computed by the IMU and write down your observations.\n",

    "Note: you cannot use the original yaw from the IMU in any analysis except this last part.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Estimate the forward velocity\n",
    "- Integrate the forward acceleration to estimate the forward velocity. Your initial values for velocity may be too low or high. You may need to make some adjustments on these data (e.g., is there velocity in another axis? Do the values make sense given your knowledge of what the car was doing?)\n",
    "- Calculate an estimate of the velocity from your GPS measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Dead reckoning with IMU Data\n",
    "- Integrate the forward velocity to obtain displacement and compare with GPS displacement. \n",
    "- We simplify the description of the motion by assuming that the vehicle is moving in a two-dimensional plane. \n",
    "- Denote the position of the center-of-mass (CM) of the vehicle by $(x,y,0)$ and its rotation rate about the CM by $(0,0,ω)$. We denote the position of the inertial sensor in space by $(x,y,0)$ and its position in the vehicle frame by $(x_c,0,0)$ so that $x_c$ represents some offset between Vectornav and car COM. \n",
    "- Then the acceleration measured by the inertial sensor (i.e. its acceleration as sensed in the vehicle frame) is \n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where all of the quantities in these equations are evaluated in the vehicle frame. \n",
    "- Assume that velocity in y (i.e., $y'$) is 0 m/s (that is, the vehicle is not skidding sideways) and ignore the offset by setting $x_c = 0$ (meaning that the IMU is on the center of mass of the vehicle). Then the first equation above reduces to $x''=x''_{obs}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Integrate this to obtain $x'$. Compute  $ωx'$ and compare it to $y''_{obs}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "How well do they agree? If there is a difference, what is it due to? Can you fix it? Plot all results\n",

    "- Compare this estimated trajectory with the GPS track by plotting them on the same plot.  Make sure to adjust starting point, so that both the tracks start at the same point and same heading (adjust heading so that the first straight line from both are oriented in the same direction).  \n",
